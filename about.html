            Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary
            approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial
            intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data

        <p>
            Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly
            programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is
            evident
            from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine
            learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

        <h3 class="title">Artificial Intelligence</h3>

        <p>
            Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
            systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition
            and
            machine vision.
